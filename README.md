# Atlantis
Remake of the Atari2600 game Atlantis using GameMaker 1.4x.

This was a quick exploration of GameMaker 1.4 over the course of a few days. The default resolution of this game is 960x544 as it was written specifically with the Playstation Vita screen in mind although it runs fine when built for Windows.

If you have a GameMaker Vita license, this works on the devkit as well.

The only thing I didn't implement was the quick ship. I may come back to this at one point.
